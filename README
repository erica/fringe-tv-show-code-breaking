NOTES ON THE NAMING PATTERN
* Images are listed by episode and order within the episode.
* The ABCDEF notes refer roughly to the yellow dot location with respect to the image, namely:
   AD
   BE
   CF
* All dot locations are rough estimates.
* The R/L notation refers to the fact that images may appear flipped. The naming for R/L is arbitrary, based on any prominent feature like the frog's foot or the daisy's wing.

FAILED APPROACHES
* Treating the six yellow dot locations as the source for Braille with one character defined per episode. Tried doing dot inverses and mirroring as well
* Grouping the dots by image.
